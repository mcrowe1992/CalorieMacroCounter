<h2>How to Do Barbell Curls</h2>

<p>1. Grip a bar with an underhand (supinated) grip, hands about shoulder-width apart.</p>
<p>2. Lift the bar with control, by flexing your elbows.</p>
<p>3. Don’t let your upper arm travel back during the curl, keep it at your side or move it slightly forward.</p>
<p>4. Reverse the movement and lower the bar back to the starting position.</p>

<br />

<p>The barbell curl is one of the most classic (and best) exercises you can do for your biceps.</p>
<br />
<p>The barbell curl primarily targets your biceps and brachialis (which lie beneath the biceps), but the forearm flexors are also involved as a secondary muscle group.</p>
