<h2>How to do Dumbbell Rows</h2>

<p>1. Start by placing a dumbbell on the floor beside a bench or chair. Stand facing the bench or chair and place your left hand and left knee on top of it.</p>
<p>2. Keep your back flat and parallel to the ground, with a slight bend in the standing leg. Grip the dumbbell with your right hand.</p>
<p>3. Inhale and pull the dumbbell by driving the elbow toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>4. With control, lower the dumbbell back to the starting position while exhaling.</p>
<p>5. Complete desired reps on one side, then switch to the opposite arm and leg.</p>

<br />

<p>The dumbbell row is an exercise where you can get a long range of motion and really focus on the working muscles.</p>
<br />
<p>The dumbbell row works your back muscles in a horizontal pulling movement. By adding a vertical pulling movement (like the pull-up or lat pulldowns) 
    and an exercise for the back extensors, (like the deadlift or a back extension), you have a complete back workout.</p>
