<h2>How to Do Hammer Curls</h2>

<p>1. Hold a pair of dumbbells in a neutral grip (palms facing each other), arms hanging by your sides.</p>
<p>2. Lift the dumbbells with control by flexing your elbows.</p>
<p>3. Don’t let your upper arms travel back during the curl. Keep them at your sides, or move them slightly forward.</p>
<p>4. Reverse the movement and lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.</p>

<br />

<p>The hammer curl is a variation of the classic dumbbell curl, in which you hold the dumbbells in a neutral grip (“hammer grip”).</p>
<br />
<p>This places the brachioradialis in a stronger position, and can likely lead to an increased training effect of this muscle.</p>
