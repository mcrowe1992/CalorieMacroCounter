<h1>What Are the Four Basic Strength Training Exercises?</h1>

<p>
    The four basic strength training exercises refer to the four fundamental movements of resistance training.

    They are four movements that, together, cover a large part of what we can do with our bodies.

    The idea is that if you do at least one exercise for each fundamental movement, you will have worked almost all your major muscle groups.

    At least one exercise from each of these four basic movements should be included in every comprehensive strength training program.

    The four fundamental movements are:
</p>

<p>
    Push something away from you. Examples: bench press, overhead press, push-ups, machine chest press.
    <br />
    Pull something towards you. Examples: pull-ups, lat pulldown, barbell row, dumbbell row, cable row.
    <br />
    Hip hinge. Examples: deadlift, good morning, Romanian deadlift, clean, kettlebell swing.
    <br />
    Squat. Examples: squat, front squat, Bulgarian split squat, goblet squat, leg press.
    <br />
    Push, pull, hinge, and squat. That’s it.
