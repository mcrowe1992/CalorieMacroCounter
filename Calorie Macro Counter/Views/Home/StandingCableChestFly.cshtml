<h2>How to do Standing Cable Chest Flys</h2>

<p>1. Fasten a pair of handles in the top position of a cable cross. Grip the handles, step forward, and lean slightly forward.</p>
<p>2. With just a slight bend in the arms, push the handles forward until they meet in front of your body.</p>
<p>3. With control, let the handles go back to the starting position.</p>

<br />

<p>Bigger and stronger pecs. The standing cable chest fly is a good isolation exercise for the chest muscles, and by incorporating it into your workout routine, you can start building both stronger and bigger pecs.</p>
<p>Constant resistance. The cable machine offers almost constant resistance, increasing the time under tension for your chest muscles.</p>
